  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I am a <strong>Principal AI &amp; Cybersecurity Architect</strong> focused on building
    <strong>AI-first threat intelligence and security platforms</strong> that operate reliably at scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work sits at the intersection of <strong>cyber threat research</strong>,
    <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>production system design</strong>.
    I design end-to-end pipelines that turn large volumes of unstructured cyber data into
    <strong>high-confidence, structured intelligence</strong> that can be trusted by analysts,
    automated systems, and downstream products.
  </p>

  <p>
    I operate as a <strong>senior individual contributor</strong>, owning systems from initial design
    through production deployment and long-term evolution. My role typically involves defining
    technical direction, making architectural trade-offs, and translating research-grade ideas
    into systems that can run continuously, predictably, and cost-effectively.
  </p>

  <h2>How I work</h2>
  <p>My approach is shaped by production constraints rather than demos.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I design systems <strong>from the data model outward</strong>, not from the UI inward.</li>
    <li>I favor <strong>precision, traceability, and explainability</strong> over raw recall when outcomes matter.</li>
    <li>I treat AI components as <strong>fallible subsystems</strong> that require guardrails, evaluation, and monitoring.</li>
    <li>I optimize for <strong>long-term maintainability</strong>, not short-term velocity.</li>
    <li>I assume systems will scale, fail, and be misused — and design accordingly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I am comfortable operating in ambiguity, but I work toward
    <strong>clear interfaces, explicit assumptions, and measurable behavior</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>What I build</h2>
  <p>Most of my work involves systems such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-driven threat intelligence enrichment pipelines</li>
    <li>Agentic LLM systems and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</li>
    <li>Entity extraction and normalization at scale</li>
    <li>Automation layers that bridge research, data, and production</li>
    <li>Platforms that balance accuracy, cost, and operational reliability</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in the <strong>practical limits of AI systems</strong> — where heuristics,
    rules, and human judgment still matter, and how to compose them effectively with machine learning.
  </p>

  <h2>What I don’t optimize for</h2>
  <p>At this stage of my career, there are things I deliberately avoid:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I don’t build AI demos that cannot be productionized.</li>
    <li>I don’t optimize for hype or novelty at the expense of correctness.</li>
    <li>I don’t treat large language models as magic components.</li>
    <li>I don’t design systems that only work under ideal conditions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I prefer fewer systems that work <strong>predictably</strong> over many systems that work <strong>occasionally</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>
    I typically work on problems that require:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>System-level thinking across multiple components</li>
    <li>Deep understanding of failure modes and trade-offs</li>
    <li>Close collaboration with research, product, and security stakeholders</li>
    <li>Long-term ownership rather than short-term delivery</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I am most effective in environments that value
    <strong>technical depth, clarity of thought, and engineering judgment</strong>.
